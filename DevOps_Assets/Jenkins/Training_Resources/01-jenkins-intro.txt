freestyle disadvantages
--------------------------
1. anyone can login and do the changes, difficult to track what went wrong
2. difficult to restore
3. I can't see the history, no versions

scripted way
----------------
1. review can be done before do something.
2. easy to restore
3. track the changes
4. maintains the history

if we install jenkins , home folder default is /var/lib/jenkins
workspace is:  /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/job-name
jenkins master-slave architecture:
--------------------------------------
1. when work is there, master calls agent and ask them to do work->ssh
2. daily agent comes to master and ask if there is any work


1)in agent need to install java,
2)in master go to manage jenkins, nodes and add agent and fill the details.
3)in worker node a workspace folder will be creted automatically which defined in master node.

WebHook:
---------
in github:
github repo -> settings -> webhook -> URL -> http://jenkins-url/github-webhook/
 content-type: application/json, select the events
In jenkins pipline:
job -> build triggers -> github hook trigger


plugin:
-------
pipeline stage view:: need to install to view stages
Ansicolor:: to see colors in console output
pipeline utility steps:: reads versions of json files,zipping of files

Jenkins- Pipeline Synatx:
---------------
pipeline{
	agent{
		label 'java-agent'
	}
	options{
		timeout(time: 30, unit: 'MINUTES')
	}
	environment{
		Greeting = 'Hello World'
	}
	parameters{
	
	}
	stages{
		stage('Build'){
			steps{
				sh 'echo this is build'
			}
		}
		stage('Test'){
			steps{
				sh 'echo this is build'
			}
		}
	}
	post{
		always{
		
		}
		success{
		
		}
		failure{
		
		}
	}
}
